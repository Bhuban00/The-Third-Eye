# The-Third-Eye
 A project for the blind people using arduino. It is a simple project. we will mainly be needimg only 3 stuff. 1. arduino uno/nano 2. ultrasonic sensor 3. buzzer
 The main reason to make this project is that many project that i have been seen in youtube just detects if any obstacle comes from the front or they have to use a stick. But the question that was pricking my mind was, What will happen if there is a hole in the ground, what will happen if there is a obstacle that is shorter then th sensors range.
 then i thought why dont we make the height of the person a constant. Then we can just check if the height is changing.
 if it changes then there is a obstacle.SIMPLE.
 The schematic and code's are given so what are you waiting for?
 Go make one for yourself.
